# asteroids
Generates 4k images of asteroids relative to time. 


#Compilation
The preferred method is to use a tool called Gradle.
You can run it however you would like, but gradle is easy and makes packaging jars simple. The hard part (creating build.gradle) is already done.

###Building

######To run the demo type:
gradle run

######To create a runnable jar type:
gradle build

The jar is found in build/libs/

######To create Intellij project files type:
gradle idea

Then select "Open Project" in Intellij and select the directory.
Intellij may ask to import the gradle project: don't bother.
