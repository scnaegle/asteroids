# asteroids
Generates 4k images of asteroids relative to time. 


#Compilation
The preferred method is to use a tool called Gradle.  
You can run it however you would like, but gradle is easy and makes packaging jars simple. The hard part (creating build.gradle) is already done.

###To run the demo type:
gradle run

###To create a runnable jar type:
gradle build

The jar is found in build/libs/

###To create Intellij project files type:
gradle idea

Then select "Open Project" in Intellij and select the directory.
Intellij may ask to import the gradle project: don't bother.

#Directory Layout
The directories follow the Apache standard.  
See: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html
